# Kotlin DevRoom - FOSDEM 2023 - Call For Proposal 

Hello fellow Kotliners,

We're back with another edition of the Kotlin DevRoom @ FOSDEM 2023. We are extremely proud to offer the Kotlin open-source community a space to meet and be represented.

And this year, we can't be more excited to share that, after 2 years of virtual devroom, we'll be back in person in 2023! Looking forward to meeting with you all on the 4th/5th of February 2023 in Brussels, Belgium.

Here you can find the CFP (Call For Papers) for submitting your talks and have the opportunity to deliver a talk during the Kotlin DevRoom. The deadline for submitting is December 4th 2022, please read below for more details on how to apply.

## About FOSDEM

From: [https://fosdem.org/2023/about/](https://fosdem.org/2023/about/)
FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organized by the community, for the community.

The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software and open source world
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers
- promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organizers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.
