# Kotlin DevRoom - FOSDEM 2022 - Call For Proposal 

⚠️ **Important: We extended the CFP deadline to January 7th 2022**

Hello fellow Kotliners,

We're back with another edition of the Kotlin DevRoom @ FOSDEM 2022. We can't be more than excited to offer the Kotlin open-source community a space to virtually meet and be represented. Looking forward to connecting with you all on the 6th of February 2022 online.

Here you can find the CFP (Call For Papers) for submitting your talks and have the opportunity to deliver a talk during the Kotlin DevRoom. The deadline for submitting is December 27th 2021, please read below for more details on how to apply.

## About FOSDEM
From: https://fosdem.org/2022/about/
FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community, for the community.
The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software and open source world
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers
- promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.

## About the Kotlin DevRoom

The Kotlin DevRoom is a co-located conference-within-a-conference that gives us the opportunity to come together and chat, hack, and share stories about Kotlin usage in the FLOSS ecosystems.

The DevRoom will take place online on Sunday, the 6th of February 2022. 

Join us to enjoy a full day of talks, demos, and interesting discussions about Kotlin!

## How to submit

We welcome any talk proposals about Kotlin-related projects.

We are looking for proposals for 25 minute talks (suggested 20 minute talk + 5 minute Q&A).
